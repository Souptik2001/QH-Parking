# Incomplete parts of the project

We regret to inform you that the parking plot database designing of the the application could not be completed. So, Here is a design how the parking plots data will be managed.

## Database schema for the parking plots data mangement

For parking management we will have two tables. One will be called *parkinglot* and another will be called *parkingspace*.
-The parkinglot table will contain the indexnumber and id of the parking lots.
-The parkingspace will contain the index number, the parking lot id, parking space id and a boolean column called free and a column called car. So from that table by applying sql queries, we can get any information like how many spaces of a parking lot are free, how many spaces over all parkinglots are free, etc.

By applying the database schema our prototype will be almost complete.

Thank you.
